MSE Question?
Is there a reason (other than convention) that when talking about lexicographic order of integer sequences we treat the empty string as lexicographically first rather than lexicographically last.

For example, in the **standard lexicographic ordering** of subsets of $\{1,2,3\}$, we have
$$
\{\} \prec \{1\} \prec \{1,2\} \prec \{1,3\} \prec \{1,2,3\} \prec \{2\} \prec \{2,3\} \prec \{3\}
$$

While in the **modified lexicographic ordering**, we have
$$
\{1,2,3\} \prec \{1,2\} \prec \{1,3\} \prec \{1\} \prec \{2,3\} \prec \{2\} \prec \{3\} \prec \{\}
$$

(Note that $\{1,2,3\} \prec \{1,2\}$ because the suffixes have the order $\{3\} \prec \{\}$.)

I suppose one advantage that the standard definition has over the modified definition is that when listing sequences of natural numbers in lexicographic order, the standard definition starts with finite sequences, and the modified definition starts with infinite sequences.

One advantage of the
