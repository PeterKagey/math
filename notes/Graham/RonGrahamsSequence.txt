Ron Graham’s Sequence

Let g(n) be the nth term of Ron Graham’s Sequence (A006255): g(n) = smallest m for which there is a sequence n = b_1 < b_2 < ... < b_t = m such that b_1*b_2*...*b_t is a perfect square.
Let f(n) be the least k > n such that k * n is a perfect square. (A072905, a surjection!)
Let h(n) Smallest values of t arising in Ron Graham's sequence (A066400)

Then I wish to prove the following three equivalent statements:
(1) n * A006255(n) is never a perfect square.
(2) f(n) > g(n) for all n; (i.e. A255167(n) > 0)
(3) h(n) != 2 for all n. (i.e. h(k) > 2 for all nonsquare k.)

g(n) & f(n) are bijections from N onto their domains. (Composites & nonsquarefree numbers respectively.)

Then I wish to prove (or disprove) the following three equivalent statements:
(1) n * A006255(n) is never a perfect square.
(2) f(n) > g(n) for all n.
(3) h(k) > 2 for all nonsquare k.

f & g are bijections onto their domains (nonsquarefree & composite numbers respectively).

(2) is true for all values of n such that g(n) is squarefree. (This takes care of asymptotically ~60.8% of numbers; g(n) = 4n for squarefree n).

Conjecture:
Given some fixed a and b, the probability that there exists an m such that
  a * n^2 < b * m^2 < a * (n+1)^2
is sqrt(a/b) as n goes to infinity.

a * n^2 < b * m^2 < a * (n+1)^2
a/b * n^2 < m^2 < a/b * (n+1)^2
Let k = a/b
k * n^2 < m^2 < k * (n+1)^2
sqrt(k) * n < m < sqrt(k) * (n+1)
n < m/sqrt(k) < n+1
let K = (1/sqrt(k))
is 1/K for K > 1 as n goes to infinity.

for all K > 1, the probability that there exists m such that
   n < K * m < n+1
is 1/K as n -> infinity.
