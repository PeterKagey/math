Graham outline:

1) Algorithm for computing g(n) in pseudo-polynomial time.
2) Proof that g(k^2*p) = p * k^2 + p for fixed k and sufficiently large p.
  a) Proof that for p > 3, g(p) = 2*p.
  b) What is the asymptotic density of n = k^2*p such that g(n) = n + p?
3) Proof that A070229(n) is a bijection between the naturals and non-squarefree numbers
4) Proof (or disproof) that A070229(n) > g(n) for all n.
5) Proof that the number of "qualifying" sequences is of the form 2^k
  a) Method for computing the number of qualifying sequences in psuedo-polynomial time.
